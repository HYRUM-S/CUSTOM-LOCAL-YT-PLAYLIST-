## CUSTOM-YT-PLAYLIST-ORGANISER 
This is a c program to sort files downloaded using  youtube playlist downloader to the original youtube playlist arrangemet

I assume that by the time you are here you have tried different playlist downloaders and you end up with 
disopganised videos. this makes watching the videos hectic and therfore i came up with this simple solution 
what if we could organise the files by just few lines of code and a list for the code to follow.

the current drawbacks i have is that the list is manually typed by the user and gets hectic for play lists with
many videos, but hopefully we can work on that .
